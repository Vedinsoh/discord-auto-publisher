/**
 * Every place a message can carry human-readable text, flattened for matching.
 *
 * `message.content` alone is not enough, and for two different reasons:
 * - Embed-only posts (RSS relays, GitHub, news bots — the bulk of what lands in an
 *   announcement channel) leave `content` empty and put everything in the embed.
 * - A Components V2 message (`IS_COMPONENTS_V2`) has *no* usable `content` or
 *   `embeds` at all — Discord requires both be empty once the flag is set, and the
 *   text lives in Text Display components instead.
 *
 * Reading only `content` therefore made a content condition silently unable to match
 * those messages, which is worse for a negated condition ("doesn't contain X" would
 * pass everything) than for a positive one.
 *
 * All of these fields are gated behind the Message Content intent, which the bot
 * holds; without it Discord returns them empty and this degrades to `content` only.
