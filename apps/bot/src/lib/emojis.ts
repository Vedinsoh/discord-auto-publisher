/**
 * Resolve this app's emojis by name and write them into `emojis`, replacing the
 * unicode fallbacks. One REST call per cluster, awaited before the cluster
 * reports ready so no reply can render a fallback the app actually owns.
 *
 * App emojis need neither `UseExternalEmojis` nor a shared guild, which is why
 * they replaced the guild-hosted set — see `emojiNames`.
 *
 * A name absent from the app is warned about rather than thrown on: the missing
 * key keeps its fallback and the rest still render. Since the four apps are
 * uploaded by hand, this warning is the only guard against a name drifting
 * between editions.
