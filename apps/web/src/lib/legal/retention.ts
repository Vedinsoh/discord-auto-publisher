/**
 * Retention periods stated in the Privacy Policy.
 *
 * Every value is the real configured lifetime, read off the code cited on its line —
 * GDPR Art 13(2)(a) wants the period or the criteria, and the previous published
 * policy's failure mode was describing a system that did not exist. If a TTL changes in
 * that code it changes here, or the notice becomes false.
 *
 * Short-lived server-side caches are published as ONE ceiling, not a per-key TTL table.
 * Neither Art 13(2)(a) nor Discord's Developer ToS s.5(a) asks for per-key figures —
 * both want the period or a description — and publishing exact numbers turns any
 * cache-tuning change on a hot path into a false statement. Keep the individual TTLs
 * under the ceiling and the notice stays true.
 *
 * Scope rule: anything we obtain from Discord and then keep gets an entry, whether or
 * not it identifies a person, because Discord's ToS covers all API Data. State we
 * derive ourselves does not — the proxy's sublimit counters and blocked-channel
 * denylist, the migration and handover markers, none of which holds a user identifier.
 * They are deliberately absent rather than accidentally missing.
