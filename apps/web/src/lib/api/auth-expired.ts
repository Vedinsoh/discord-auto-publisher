/**
 * Guild-detail load-failure signalling, importable from BOTH server and client
 * (no 'server-only'/'use client' directive) — the streamed guild-detail promise
 * is mapped to a serializable sentinel on the server and unwrapped on the
 * client.
 *
 * Errors thrown across the RSC boundary are sanitized (identity + status lost,
 * only a digest survives), so the streamed promise resolves to one of these
 * sentinels instead of rejecting; the client branches on the sentinel to pick a
 * recovery. See ADR 0010.
 *
 * Four failure kinds, four recoveries:
 * - `AUTH_EXPIRED` (backend 401): the embedded Discord OAuth token is dead while
 *   the NextAuth session is still "valid" — re-login.
 * - `BOT_ABSENT` (409 `BOT_NOT_PRESENT`): the guild is viewable, there is just no
 *   bot in it — stay on the page and offer the invite; the config still exists.
 * - `GUILD_UNAVAILABLE` (403 / 404): the user genuinely can't view this guild —
 *   redirect to the server list.
 * - `TRANSIENT_ERROR` (5xx / network): an upstream blip — stay on the page and
 *   let the user retry in place, rather than ejecting to the server list.
 *
 * The 409 split is the ONLY place the web reads a backend error `code` rather
 * than its status, so `BOT_NOT_PRESENT` must keep that exact string.
