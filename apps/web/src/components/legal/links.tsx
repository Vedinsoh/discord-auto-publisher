/**
 * Link helpers for the .mdx legal documents.
 *
 * These exist because MDX does not evaluate expressions inside a markdown link
 * destination: `[text](mailto:{entity.email})` ships the literal
 * `mailto:%7Bentity.email%7D` as the href. It renders plausibly and fails silently, so
 * anything with a computed href must be JSX.
 *
 * The two addresses are not interchangeable. `CompanyEmail` is the legal entity's own
 * address, published because ZEIT cl. 6(1) requires one for the service provider, and it
 * appears only in the imprint. `SupportEmail` is the monitored inbox, so every duty that
 * is about being *answered* points there: ZZP cl. 10 complaints, GDPR Arts 15-22
 * requests, withdrawal notices, security reports. Naming different addresses is lawful —
 * what matters is that whichever one a document names is actually monitored.
