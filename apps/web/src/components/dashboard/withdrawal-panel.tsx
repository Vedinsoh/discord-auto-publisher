/**
 * The statutory withdrawal function — ZZP čl. 81.a / CRD Art 11a. Rules a
 * well-meaning UX change would break (reasoning in .claude/CLAUDE.md):
 *
 * - The labelled entry control stays on the page (st. 2); the statement may live in
 *   a dialog.
 * - One screen, one button, no draft stage — and nothing between the two: no
 *   survey, no retention offer, no discount.
 * - The confirm button carries the statutory words and nothing else: no icon, no
 *   spinner, no second verb.
 * - Labels are English by choice; no article prescribes a language. ⚠️ Do not extend
 *   that to the /refunds disclosure naming this control — čl. 60 st. 9 does bind it.
 * - The contract is shown in labelled fields so there is something to confirm; the
 *   consumer's name is never asked for again.
