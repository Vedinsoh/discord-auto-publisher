    answer: (
      <>
        It automatically publishes messages posted in your{' '}
        <InlineLink href={ANNOUNCEMENT_CHANNELS_HELP}>announcement channels</InlineLink> — the same
        as pressing the publish button yourself — so your announcements reach the servers that
        follow your channel. It is especially handy for messages from other bots or webhooks that
        you would otherwise have to publish by hand. Note: Auto Publisher never creates messages; it
        only publishes ones already posted by you, another bot, or a webhook.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I set it up?',
    answer: (
      <>
        Invite the bot, then use <code className="text-slate-200">/ap enable</code> or the web
        dashboard to choose the announcement channels it should manage. Make sure the bot has these
        permissions in each of those channels:{' '}
        <span className="text-slate-200">View Channel, Send Messages, and Manage Messages</span>.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: 'Why are my messages being delayed from publishing?',
    answer: (
      <>
        During busy periods Auto Publisher paces out publishing to stay within Discord&apos;s rate
        limits so it never gets blocked. This is normal — even instant publishes take a moment to
        reach every following server, depending on how many follow your channel.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: 'Why can only 10 messages per channel per hour be published?',
    answer: (
      <>
        That is a hard limit set by Discord, not by us — even a person cannot publish more than 10
        messages per channel per hour. There is no way around it. Anything posted past that limit in
        the same hour is not published, so a channel carrying a busy feed will not have all of it
        crossposted.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I self-host the bot?',
    answer: (
      <>
        Yes, for servers you run yourself. The full source is published on{' '}
        <InlineLink href={links.githubRepo}>GitHub</InlineLink> under a source-available licence, so
        you are welcome to read it, learn from it, and run your own copy. Hosting an instance for
        other people is not covered by that licence — and there is no need to, since adding the
        public bot is free. Auto Publisher is built to run at scale across many servers, and we do
        not provide support for self-hosted instances, so treat those as a project for tinkering.
