# Project tech stack

- Monorepo architecture using Turborepo
  - apps in ./apps
  - packages in ./packages - prefixed with "@ap/" when imported in apps
- Docker for containerization
  - Docker container networking for inter-service communication
  - Development & production scripts in ./scripts
- bun runtime & package manager
- TypeScript & ES modules
- Biome.js for linting & formatting

## Common commands

### Self-host stack (root docker-compose.yml)

```bash
cp .env.example .env        # four values; three from one Discord application
docker compose up -d        # bot + proxy + backend + web + db + redis
docker compose logs -f
docker compose down
```

Uses `.env` (which Compose auto-reads) and needs no scripts, no Supabase CLI and no flags.
Maintainer dev keeps `.env.local`, which takes precedence over `.env`.

### Development (public two-edition stack)

```bash
bun run dev:start           # Start full dev environment (both editions, Docker Compose)
bun run dev:start:free      # Start one edition only (bot + proxy + backend + redis)
bun run dev:start:premium
bun run dev:watch           # Start with hot reload (--watch); :free / :premium variants too
bun run dev:stop            # Stop everything (down + volumes + Supabase + prune)
bun run dev:stop:free       # Stop only that edition's bot + proxy (backend/redis/Supabase keep running)
bun run dev:stop:premium
bun run dev:logs            # View dev logs
bun run dev:ps              # List dev containers
bun run dev:cache           # Access Redis cache container
```

Outbound mail is caught locally by the `mailpit` service — inbox and REST API at
http://localhost:8025, SMTP on `127.0.0.1:1025`.

### Production

```bash
bun run prod:start       # Start production containers
bun run prod:stop        # Stop production containers
bun run prod:logs        # View production logs
bun run prod:ps          # List production containers
```

### Build & Code Quality

```bash
bun run build            # Build all workspace packages
bun run clean            # Clean build artifacts
bun run check-types      # Type check all packages
bun run check            # Lint/format check (Biome)
bun run check:fix        # Lint/format auto-fix
bun run db:generate      # Generate Drizzle SQL migration files
bun run db:migrate       # Apply pending migrations to database
```

### Supabase (local dev)

```bash
supabase start           # Start local Supabase (PostgreSQL on localhost:54322)
supabase stop            # Stop local Supabase
supabase status          # Show local Supabase status and connection info
```

## Architecture overview

### Two deployment shapes

**`DEPLOYMENT_MODE=public`** — the commercial service: per-edition bots + proxies, a single edition-agnostic backend, one Postgres, one Redis (ADR 0006).

```
bot-free ────► proxy-free ─────┐            ┌──> PostgreSQL (Supabase)
    │              ▲           │ Discord    │

bot-premium ─► proxy-premium ──┘
(bots POST /crosspost/:g/:c/:m to their own edition's proxy)
```

**`DEPLOYMENT_MODE=self-host`** (the default) — one bot, every feature, no billing. Root `docker-compose.yml`, six always-on services (`bot`, `proxy`, `backend`, `web`, `db`, `redis`); Postgres and Redis are bundled, so the Supabase CLI is maintainer-only. ADR 0011.

```
bot ──► proxy ──► Discord REST        db (postgres:17-alpine)
 │        ▲                            ▲
 └─HTTP─► backend ─────────────────────┴──> redis
             ▲
            web (Next.js dashboard, server-side calls only)
```

The single bot **registers as edition `premium`**, which is what the existing per-guild logic already resolves to when no free bot is present: `getManagingEdition` → `premium`, `channelLimitFor` → 0 (unlimited), `assertPremiumActive` passes. No third edition literal, no schema change. The one thing that had to change is the entitlement gate in `registerNewGuild`, which is now public-only — otherwise the premium bot finds no subscription row and **leaves every guild it joins**.

Self-host skips: the Paddle webhook route, the subscription/checkout/withdrawal API routes, the subscription + withdrawal-acknowledgement crons, the handover internal route, and every billing surface in the dashboard. Sweeps iterate `Editions.CONFIGURED` (`['premium']` vs `['free','premium']`) rather than a hardcoded pair — a hardcoded pair makes the guild reconcile treat the missing edition as an incomplete sweep and silently disable its own join rails and channel-limit backstop on every run.

**proxy** (apps/proxy, one instance per edition):

- Discord REST gateway + async crosspost queue for its edition's bot token. Replaces the old `@discordjs/proxy-container` + `crosspost-worker` pair.
- Two responsibilities:
  - `POST /crosspost/:guildId/:channelId/:messageId` — sync gate check, then BullMQ enqueue. ACKs 202 in <100ms. The `guildId` segment exists to resolve the onboarding-boost tier; all three segments are validated against `SNOWFLAKE_PATTERN`.
  - `*/api/*` passthrough — generic Discord REST proxy used by its bot + the backend's per-edition `@discordjs/rest`. Selective header forwarding, response streamed back.
- Single `@discordjs/rest` instance shared by both paths. Interaction acks bypass crosspost queue naturally via `BurstHandler`.
- Per-edition Redis DBs via `ProxyDatabaseIDs` in `@ap/redis` (free: 1/2/3, premium: 9/10/11 for queue/sublimit/blocked), plus two shared DBs: `Alerts` (8) and `OnboardingBoost` (14).
- **Queue priority tiers** (`PRIORITY` in `crosspost/queue.ts`): `BOOSTED = 1`, `NORMAL = 10` — lower is higher priority, valid range `1..2_097_152`. **Every `queue.add` must pass an explicit priority.** BullMQ serves un-prioritized jobs _before_ prioritized ones (`fetchNextJob.lua` `RPOPLPUSH`es from `wait` first and only falls back to the prioritized zset when `wait` is empty; `priority: 0` means "no priority"), so one untagged enqueue starves every boosted guild behind a backlog that at peak never drains — strictly worse than plain FIFO. Regression check: `bull:crosspost:wait` stays empty under load while `bull:crosspost:prioritized` carries the depth. ADR 0012.
- **Onboarding boost**: a newly-joined guild's first 10 successful publishes get `BOOSTED`. Budget is `boost:{guildId}` in DB 14 (integer remaining, 90d TTL); **key presence is the boost state**. `isBoosted` at enqueue **fails closed** (a fail-open blip would promote the whole base); `consume` (`DECR`, `DEL` at `<= 0`) runs in the worker's success branch gated on `job.opts.priority === BOOSTED`, never on a fresh read — an unconditional `DECR` would mint a negative key per guild. Seeded by the backend from `registerNewGuild` only; boosted enqueues log at `info` (bounded, measurable in prod), normal ones at `debug`.
- Egress IP pinning: `config.egressLocalAddress` (from `EGRESS_LOCAL_ADDRESS_FREE`/`_PREMIUM`) sets an undici `Agent({ connect: { localAddress } })` so each edition keeps its own source IP (per-edition Cloudflare ban isolation). Unset = default route (dev).
- Sync pre-check pipeline (gate): `invalid_requests` shed → `BlockedChannels` denylist → `SublimitCounter` (per-channel 10/hr).
- BullMQ worker (concurrency 50) classifies Discord error outcomes:
  - `already_done` / `blocked` / `sublimit` (intentional skip + cache update)
  - `transient_429` / `global_ratelimit` → `job.moveToDelayed` with `Retry-After`
  - `5xx` / network → BullMQ exponential backoff (10 attempts)
- Cloudflare-ban self-shed at 5,000 invalid requests / 10 min (half of Discord's 10k ceiling). Tracked in-memory via `RESTEvents.Response`, excluding shared 429s.
- Runs on port 8080 (internal); dev exposes proxy-free on 8081, proxy-premium on 8082. Healthcheck on `/health`. Stats on `/info`.
- Tech stack: `@discordjs/rest`, BullMQ + ioredis (queue), Express, undici (egress pinning), pino via `@ap/logger`.

**bot** (apps/bot, one instance per edition — keeps `APP_EDITION` + its own token via `config.discordToken`):

- Discord bot app for receiving events and running commands
- Uses Sapphire Framework (https://sapphirejs.dev/docs/General/Welcome) built on discord.js
- Uses discord-hybrid-sharding for horizontal scaling across multiple shards & clusters; `ClusterManager` does manual exponential-backoff respawn (5s/30s/60s/5min/10min) to avoid burning the invalid-request budget.
- Entry: `ClusterManager` spawns sharded workers via `lib/shard.ts`.
- Listens for `messageCreate` in announcement channels. **Hot path is fully synchronous + cache-only**:
  1. `isCrosspostable` bit-flag check (system, IsCrosspost, Crossposted)
  2. `canCrosspostInChannel` — sync `permissionsFor(members.me)` (never `.fetch()`)
  3. `Handover.isActive(guildId)` — premium only: in-memory latch once active; `PremiumPending` Redis check per message only while a handover is pending (free bot: unconditionally true)
  4. `Guild.isMigrated(guildId)` Redis lookup; if migrated → `Channel.isEnabled(channelId)` Redis lookup (else bail)
  5. `Filter.evaluate` (premium-only HTTP to backend; matching itself is in-process)
  6. 5s delay if URL without embed (lets Discord generate embeds)
  7. `Data.API.Proxy.enqueueCrosspost(channelId, messageId)` — raw `fetch` POST, fire-and-forget
- Permission listeners (`channelUpdate`, `guildMemberUpdate`, `roleUpdate`) call `DELETE /internal/blocked/:c` on the proxy to invalidate the denylist when perms are restored; on the premium bot they additionally ping `POST /internal/handover/:guildId/evaluate` while the guild is pending.
- Guild lifecycle calls to the backend carry the bot's edition (`POST /guild/:id/new` and `DELETE /guild/:id` body `{edition}`); the backend owns all join/leave decisions — there is no bot-side subscription check. Lifecycle calls retry transient failures (network/5xx, 3 attempts); all backend calls log non-ok responses (`data/api/backend.ts`).
- **Discord REST routed through its edition's proxy `/api/*`** (`config.proxyUrl`, `globalRequestsPerSecond: Infinity` — proxy is the global limiter).
- **`/ap filters <channel>`** (premium only, registered behind `config.isPremiumInstance`): one ephemeral Components V2 panel mirroring the dashboard's rule editor — one Section per condition with an inline pencil accessory opening a per-condition focus view (Edit / Remove / Back), All/Any buttons, and a type select + "Add condition" button. Driven by a message-component collector (`idle: 600_000`), not persistent interaction handlers; every action persists live through the existing per-filter endpoints and the panel re-renders from a fresh `Services.Channel.getStatus` read, so Discord and the dashboard can't disagree. Handlers: `handlers/ap/filter/{panel,render,modal,meta}.ts` (`meta.ts` is the bot-side mirror of the web's `filter-meta.ts` copy — `keyword` reads as "Content"). Notable constraints baked in: pages hold 8 conditions because each costs 3 of a message's 40 components (worst-case view is 39, counting the container itself — one slot of slack, so adding any component to the list view overflows a full page); picking a type only arms the form and the button opens it (a select fires on _change_, so opening on pick left a dismissed form unreopenable); the per-channel cap is never displayed, only enforced with an error on the 51st (matches the web); per-type value caps live in `MAX_VALUES` (`@ap/validations`, re-exported by `meta.ts`; the web keeps a hand-written mirror only because it deliberately depends on `@ap/api-types` alone) — uniform at 25 today because that is Discord's `max_values` ceiling for the selects the mention/author forms are built on, but kept keyed by type so one can be tuned later; mention values are resolved against the guild role list to render `<@&id>` vs `<@id>`; and the modal wait is kept under the collector's idle window so a form can't submit into an expired panel.
- **`/ap overview`** (no arguments — replaced `/ap status`, whose per-channel branch was dropped: the list already names every registered channel and the exact permissions to grant, and `/ap filters` covers per-channel detail) mirrors the dashboard Overview. Migrated guilds: registered channels regrouped broken-first (`canPublish === false`) with Discord sidebar order preserved inside each group via the shared `sortBySidebarOrder` (`@ap/utils`), per-row `Publishing` / `Not publishing` labels, the same header copy, then the missing-permission instructions and any paused channels. Sidebar order is rebuilt from the bot's own channel cache (`rawPosition`/`parentId`) because the backend returns registered channel ids in DB order; `canPublish` is the cache-only permission check, never a `.fetch()`. Three further states, all matching the dashboard: **legacy** guilds get a non-itemized card that collapses the dashboard's _two_ legacy surfaces (the amber migrate banner in `dashboard-banners.tsx` and `LegacyStatus` in `channel-status.tsx`) into one reply — the banner's copy verbatim, since it is the wording that states the consequence, then `### Legacy mode ends on <t:…:D>`, then an ActionRow of `Migrate now` (the guild dashboard) + `Learn what is changing` (`links.migration`, deployment-relative so a self-hosted copy serves its own `/migration`), then the `Publishing in N of M announcement channels` summary — rather than the empty state they used to hit — legacy guilds have no `channel` rows, so an allowlist read alone can't distinguish "publishes everything" from "publishes nothing"; `GET /guild/:id/channels` therefore also returns `migrated` (from Postgres `guild.migratedAt` — deliberately not the `MigratedGuilds` Redis cache, which fails closed to `false` and would tell a migrated guild it publishes everything). **Empty** splits on whether the guild has any announcement channels at all (counted from the bot's channel cache). **Empty-but-paused** keeps the paused block instead of early-returning, so a downgraded guild still learns where its channels went. Every reply ends in a Section with an `Open dashboard` link button (`Buttons.dashboard(guildId)`, a factory — the URL is guild-scoped). Two hard constraints baked in: the channel list is **one joined string in a single Text Display**, so it costs 1 component no matter the channel count (never give a row its own Section — that is what forces the filter panel's `CONDITIONS_PER_PAGE = 8`); and it truncates at `MAX_LISTED_CHANNELS = 25` / `MAX_LISTED_PAUSED = 10` with an overflow line, because a hydrated app emoji is ~32 chars and the message caps at 4000 — the broken-first sort means truncation only ever drops healthy rows. Copy that names the free channel cap reads `config.limits.freeChannelsPerGuild`, never `channelsPerGuild`: the premium bot renders these strings too while a handover is pending, and its own cap is `0`.
- **Filter matching reads the whole message, not just `content`** (`utils/messageText.ts` → `extractMessageText`): `message.content`, then each embed's `author.name` / `title` / `description` / `fields[].name` + `.value` / `footer.text`, then Components V2 Text Display text walked recursively through Container and Section. Newline-joined so a keyword can't match across a boundary a reader doesn't see (`title: "foo"` + `description: "bar"` must not satisfy `foobar`). Required because an embed-only post (RSS relays, GitHub, news bots — most of what an announcement channel carries) leaves `content` empty, and a Components V2 message has _no_ usable `content` or `embeds` at all — Discord forces both empty once `IS_COMPONENTS_V2` is set, so a content condition previously could never match one. The silent-failure direction mattered most: a negated condition ("doesn't contain X") saw an empty string, so it passed everything. All these fields are gated behind the Message Content intent, which the bot holds. Text is _not_ lowercased — the keyword patterns already carry `iu`.
- **Emojis are app-owned, resolved by name at startup** (`lib/emojis.ts` → `hydrateEmojis`, awaited in `listeners/ready.ts` before `cluster.triggerReady()`): `client.application.emojis.fetch()` once per cluster (through the edition's proxy), matched against `emojiNames` in `lib/constants/index.ts`, written in place into the `emojis` record so all ~60 call sites keep reading `emojis.checkmark` synchronously. **No emoji ids are hardcoded anywhere** — the same names exist in all four apps (free/premium × dev/prod), only the snowflakes differ, so nothing needs a per-client map, env var, or DB row. Replaced a guild-hosted set on the support server: a guild emoji only renders for a bot sharing that guild, and the handover rails keep exactly one edition per guild — support server included — so whichever edition was evicted rendered raw `<:name:id>` text. App emojis need neither `UseExternalEmojis` nor shared membership, so this fixes it without special-casing the rails or putting both bots in one guild. Uploads are manual (portal, per app); `emojis` initializes to unicode fallbacks and a missing name logs `emojis.missing` with the names rather than throwing, so a partial upload degrades cosmetically and visibly instead of silently. `Buttons.botInvite` is a factory, not a module-scope builder, because a builder created at import time would capture the fallback forever.
- Listens for guildDelete/channelDelete for cleanup (guildDelete also clears the handover latch)
- Tech stack: discord.js (https://discord.js.org/docs/packages/discord.js/main & https://discordjs.guide/), Sapphire, discord-hybrid-sharding (https://github.com/meister03/discord-hybrid-sharding/blob/ts-rewrite/README.md)

**backend** (apps/backend, single instance, edition-agnostic — no `APP_EDITION`; Paddle always on for the public instance, never instantiated when self-hosted):

- **Internal API for both bots + web dashboard API** — owns channel registration, filters, Paddle subscriptions, per-edition bot presence, the premium entitlement gate, and handover orchestration.
- Express REST API (https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html) on port 8080
- Manages PostgreSQL persistence (Drizzle ORM + Supabase) & Redis caches: `Channels` (allowlist + filters), `MigratedGuilds` (v6→v7 migration markers, derived from `guild.migratedAt`), `DiscordAuth` (web auth tokens), `PaddleWebhookDedupe` (webhook idempotency keys), `PublishState` (per-guild publish-state hash, bots push), `PremiumPending` (handover markers), `OnboardingBoost` (seeded in `registerNewGuild`, deleted in `purge`; the proxies consume it).
- Cache sync on startup (reconciles Redis/Postgres).
- **Two `@discordjs/rest` clients** (`Discord.restFor(edition)`), each routed through its edition's proxy; callers pick by managing edition (`Editions.getManagingEdition`). Token and proxy URL resolve through `tokenFor`/`proxyUrlFor`, which read the singular self-host variables or the per-edition pair depending on mode — so self-host's `free` slot has an empty token and `hasToken('free')` is false, which is exactly what the presence sweeps and join rails already key off.
- Join orchestration in `Guilds.registerNewGuild(guildId, edition, channels)`: premium not entitled → leave via premium proxy; premium joining while free active → `PremiumPending` marker + immediate handover evaluation; free joining while premium manages → leave via free proxy.
- Handover machinery (`services/handover.ts`): marker CRUD, blocked-channel evaluation (premium bot's effective permissions over registered channels — legacy guilds: all announcement channels — via `services/botPermissions.ts`), swap executor (DEL marker → free-bot leave, alert on leave failure). Re-evaluated on premium join, bot permission pings, and dashboard loads.
- Paddle (merchant of record) integration for premium subscriptions: backend-created transactions for the web overlay checkout, Customer Portal sessions, `POST /webhooks/paddle` (signature-verified, Redis-deduped), daily reconcile cron against the Paddle API. Postgres is the subscription source of truth; entitled statuses are `active`/`trialing`/`past_due`. ⚠️ Being merchant of record means Paddle grants buyers **its own** 14-day cancellation right under its Checkout Buyer Terms ("right to cancel this Agreement and return the Product within 14 days"), entirely separate from our statutory function — so a refund can happen with **no `withdrawal` row**, and any reasoning about refund volume that reads only that table undercounts. The `adjustment.created` + `adjustment.updated` webhooks are the only way we learn about those (`ADJUSTMENT_EVENTS` in `routes/api/webhooks.ts` → `Subscriptions.recordRefund`), and subscribing in code does nothing until the two events are ticked on the Paddle notification destination — sandbox _and_ live, separately, with no error either way when they are missing.
- **Migration-before-Premium gate**: `POST /subscription/checkout` rejects a legacy guild (`migratedAt IS NULL`) with `409` + `code: NOT_MIGRATED` before creating the Paddle transaction — Premium's value (per-channel filters/control) lives on registered channel rows that only exist post-migration. Mirrored client-side: the web subscription panel shows a "finish channel setup" card + a locked upgrade button while `!data.migrated` (`FreeSubscription` in `subscription-panel.tsx`), opening the existing `LegacyMigrateModal`. Any migration path (migrate modal, channels-page enable, `/ap enable`) satisfies it — all set `migratedAt`. MIGRATION: remove with the rest of the migration UX at sunset.
- **Statutory withdrawal function** (ZZP čl. 81.a / CRD Art 11a; consolidation NN 19/22, 59/23, 59/26, **na snazi od 19.06.2026** — NN 59/26 čl. 66 pins `članaka 28. do 44.` (čl. 28 inserts čl. 81.a) to `19. lipnja 2026.`, out of the act's default eight-day rule. ⚠️ The `17.06.2026` on the zakon.hr header is the **consolidation's** date (9.6.2026 + 8 days), not this article's; an earlier note here cited it _over_ 19 June and had it backwards): `services/withdrawal.ts` + **one** subscriber-only endpoint on the guild subscription route, `POST /subscription/withdrawal`, which writes the `withdrawal` row (stamping `submittedAt` and `confirmedAt` together) and then fires the effects. **One screen, one button, one call — that is the statute's shape, not a shortcut**: Art 11a has exactly one sending event, since 11a(2) gives the withdrawal function the job of "enabl[ing] the consumer to **send**" the statement, 11a(3) makes the confirmation function the thing that **submits** it, and 11a(4) hangs the acknowledgement off its activation. The two acts the statute separates are activating the entry control and activating the confirm button — not "save a draft" then "send it later". Nothing in Art 11a or čl. 81.a requires an unsent statement to be persisted, retrievable or reviewable (verified against the OJ text, including a search for persistence wording), so there is no pending/draft row and no `WithdrawalPending` type; the confirm button being **disabled until the address is filled** is what discharges 11a(3)'s "once the consumer has completed … shall enable". The earlier two-step version created exactly one bug and no benefit: an unconfirmed row was sticky, so a consumer who reloaded was pinned to a review screen forever with no way to correct the address or abandon. A partial unique index (`withdrawal_confirmed_subscription_unique`, on `paddle_subscription_id WHERE confirmed_at IS NOT NULL`) is the double-confirm guard — the route's pre-check is not atomic with the insert and the effects include a **refund**, so `record()` uses `onConflictDoNothing` and `undefined` means "already withdrawn". Eligibility and the server-composed statement ride on `GET /subscription` so the control paints with the other billing controls (recital 37: no "procedures to find or access the function"). Rules baked in, each of which a plausible UX change would break: **the window anchors on `subscription.withdrawalPeriodStartsAt`**, sticky across renewals — CJEU C-565/22 (Sofatutor) reaches the same result for the anchor, but ⚠️ its ratio is **transparency, not contract formation** — para 48 reasons that "the contractual terms brought to the attention of the consumer do not change", so the stickiness we rely on is a consequence of having disclosed the renewal terms properly, NOT of a renewal legally concluding nothing (the earlier note here said the latter; it is wrong). Anchoring on `currentPeriodStartsAt` would hand every subscriber a fresh 14-day full-refund right every billing period, and since pre-contractual information becomes part of the contract (ZZP čl. 60 st. 2) we would be bound to it; the anchor is re-stamped **only** on a price/interval change (Sofatutor paras 43/48 leave that open, and re-opening is the bounded side of the gap). Two `withResolvedAnchors` rules guard that, and both were live bugs caught against real data: `isPlanChange` requires **both** sides non-null, since a stored NULL means "not recorded yet" and a NULL→value backfill re-stamped months-old contracts to the moment of the first reconcile; and the `existingByGuild` branch (a _different_ `paddleSubscriptionId` for the guild — always a re-subscribe, i.e. a newly concluded contract) writes `values` verbatim instead, because inheriting the previous row's anchor on an unchanged price left the new consumer with an expired window and no withdrawal right at all. Availability is keyed to the window and **nothing else** — never `status`, never `cancelScheduled` (a consumer who cancelled on day 3 still has until day 14; that asymmetry is the exact bug Paddle's own `cancelSubscription` deep link has). `submittedAt` decides timeliness (st. 7) and equals `confirmedAt` by construction; both columns are kept because they answer different statutory questions (st. 7 timeliness vs. "a withdrawal happened", which retention and the ack-retry sweep read), never because they can differ. `consumerName`/`contractReference` are composed server-side and stored as presented (čl. 64 burden of proof — verified verbatim: "U vezi s obvezom obavještavanja iz ovoga poglavlja teret dokaza je na trgovcu"; ⚠️ čl. 81 st. 5, which puts proving _proper exercise_ on the consumer, is scoped to `ovoga članka` and so does **not** textually reach čl. 81.a — the Directive side matches, Art 11(4) being likewise confined to "this Article" and never extended to Art 11a, and čl. 81.a st. 7 is a deeming rule about timing, not a burden rule), never accepted from the client. **`composeStatement` is built FROM `composeContractDisplay`, never alongside it** — st. 6 (= Art 11a(4)) owes the acknowledgement the statement's **content** plus the date and time of submission, that content being the closed three-item list in st. 3 (= Art 11a(2)): name, contract identification, electronic means. A field composed independently of the screen lands in an email attributing to the consumer something they were never shown. `uključujući` is a **floor, not a ceiling** (st. 5 closes its list with `samo`; st. 6 does not), which is what permits the operational "what happens next" section — keep it: a consumer whose premium bot has just left needs to know to re-invite the free one. Nothing further is owed: Arts 13/14 impose reimbursement duties but **no** notification duty, and no EU rule puts the trader's postal address in a transactional email (e-Commerce Art 5 attaches to the site imprint; its Art 6 needs only identifiability and fires on "designed to promote"). **The refund is `type: 'full'`** — čl. 84 st. 8/9 allow a pro-rata deduction only against an express čl. 77 request to begin performance in the withdrawal period, and Commission Notice C/2021/8598 §5.6.1 says a general-terms tickbox is not one; our checkout has only the combined Terms acceptance. Effects order is acknowledgement → refund → cancel-immediately, the last routed through the existing `applyPaddleSubscription` → `enforceTransition` path rather than a second revocation mechanism. Because availability ignores `status`, that last effect regularly runs against a contract Paddle has **already cancelled** (the day-3 canceller), which answers `400 subscription_update_when_canceled` — `PaddleService.cancelSubscriptionImmediately` treats that code as success and re-reads the subscription so the caller still applies real Paddle state; before that it surfaced as a `withdrawal-cancel-failed` alert claiming the subscription was still running. The cancel is still **attempted** every time rather than skipped on our stored `status`: the stale direction that matters (our row says cancelled, Paddle still billing) would leave a withdrawn consumer paying. Acknowledgement email (st. 6) is sent once inline and, on failure, alerted and retried every 10 minutes — `acknowledgedAt` is stamped only on an accepted send, because a row claiming a statutory confirmation went out when it did not is worse than no row. **UI shape** (`withdrawal-panel.tsx`, every point verified against primary sources rather than assumed): the labelled entry control stays on the page — st. 2 attaches "istaknuta … lako uočljiv" and "tijekom trajanja roka" to the control — while the statement lives in a **dialog**, which recital 36 permits since its test is _comparative_ ("not more burdensome than the procedure for the conclusion") and checkout is itself a Paddle overlay; labels are **English-only** (verified: neither Art 11a nor čl. 81.a contains any language provision, and no recital of Dir. 2023/2673 mentions language, so the panel _and_ the acknowledgement email are unconstrained; the three official strings also diverge — EN "withdraw from contract here", HR Directive "odustati od ugovora", ZZP "raskid ugovora" — so the duty is meaning, not a fixed string) — the separate question of which language the čl. 60 st. 1 disclosures owe is a duty on a different surface and is tracked in the maintainer's compliance notes, not here; the contract is identified in **two labelled fields**, server and plan (`WithdrawalState.contractDisplay`, server-composed, never stored — the guild id is deliberately off-screen), because Art 11a(2)(b) lets the consumer "provide **or confirm**" and confirming something never shown is not confirming, while the consumer's name is omitted (recital 37 relieves a logged-in consumer of providing their identification _or_ the contract's); a factual **finality warning** and the **full-refund** statement sit on the same screen, which is unrestricted — "only with the words" is grammatically confined to the confirm button's _label_, proven by the deliberate asymmetry with 11a(1), which labels the entry control with **no** "only"; ⚠️ ZZP čl. 81.a st. 5 **drops the "samo"** that both the EN and HR Directive texts carry (re-verified side by side; it also drops `lako čitljiva`, so the divergence is two counts, not one), so the Croatian statute alone is looser — CRD Art 4 maximum harmonisation is why the stricter EU reading governs, hence the confirm button carries **no icon or spinner**; and **nothing persists after the outcome** — `shouldOfferWithdrawal` renders nothing once `confirmedAt` is set, since the durable medium is the email and a web page is not one (C-49/11 _Content Services_ paras 46/50), and a live withdrawal control on an already-withdrawn contract would be its own unfairness problem. Business buyers are **not** gated out: a legal person can never be a consumer, but a VAT ID on a _natural_ person proves nothing about the purpose of that contract (C-570/21: 35% business use, still a consumer). Misclassifying a freelancer is the costlier error of the two, against the bounded cost of occasionally refunding a business; the exposure is quantified in the maintainer's compliance notes.
- **Free trial** (14 days, card required, **one per guild ever**): two extra Paddle prices (`PADDLE_PRICE_ID_MONTHLY_TRIAL` / `_YEARLY_TRIAL`) that duplicate the plain ones plus `trial_period: {interval: 'day', frequency: 14}`. It exists to make the statutory withdrawal cheap rather than to sell harder: the window and the trial are both 14 days from the same instant, so a consumer who withdraws has been charged nothing and the mandatory full refund is a $0 event. Three properties hold it together, and each is a thing a plausible change breaks. **(1) The trial belongs to the PRICE, not the checkout** — a trial subscriber keeps the trial price id for the subscription's life, so conversion to paid is not a price change and `isPlanChange` does not re-stamp `withdrawalPeriodStartsAt`; a "trial flag" at checkout that swapped price at conversion would re-open a 14-day full-refund window over the first real charge. **(2) Exactly 14 days**, because `withdrawalPeriodStartsAt` comes from Paddle's `started_at`, which for a trial subscription is the trial start and not `first_billed_at` (documented: "may be different from `first_billed_at` if the subscription started in trial"), and `isWithinWindow` is strict `<` — so billing at start + 14d lands with the window already shut. Shorter bills inside the window; longer leaves paid days with no withdrawal right. **(3) Rule A — one per guild, ever** (`Subscriptions.isTrialAvailable`, `!existing`), keyed on the guild because a Discord account is free to create. Load-bearing, not a nicety — removing it is how the trial becomes repeatable; the analysis is in the maintainer's compliance notes (kept outside the repo). "Ever" is really "until retention hard-deletes the row at 11 years"; the row is overwritten on re-subscribe, never dropped. `premiumTrialEnabled` (`@ap/config`) requires **both** price ids — one alone would advertise a trial on one interval and charge immediately on the other — and clearing either is the kill switch — ⚠️ but only for the app: the trial paragraphs in `apps/web/src/app/(legal)/{terms,refunds}/page.mdx` are static prose and do NOT read the gate, and ZZP čl. 60 st. 2 makes pre-contractual information part of the contract, so pulling the trial means clearing the ids **and** editing those two pages **and** bumping `LEGAL_DOCUMENTS_VERSION`.
- **The trial's disclosure is a launch gate, not polish.** C-565/22 (_Sofatutor_) guarantees the withdrawal right "only once" for a contract with an initial free period **only if** the consumer was told at conclusion, clearly and explicitly, that payment follows it — para 45 grounds that in Art 6(1)(e) + Art 8(2), i.e. the point of purchase, not the legal pages. Para 50: absent that, a **new** right of withdrawal is recognised _after_ the free period, attaching to the **paid** contract — a full refund of a real charge, every buyer. So the sticky anchor and the trial only coexist because the disclosure is correct. It is stated in three places, all gated on the trial actually being configured/available: `/premium` (`PricingPlans`, `trialOffered` from `premiumTrialEnabled` server-side, qualified "once per server" because the page is not guild-scoped), the upgrade panel (`FreeSubscription`, from `GuildDashboardData.trialAvailable`), and the page behind the Paddle overlay (`/checkout`, `?trial=1`). `trialAvailable` is **server-decided by the same predicate the checkout route picks the price with** — never re-derived client-side from `subscription === null`, which is wrong for a guild whose subscription was cancelled, and the wrong direction (promising a trial we then bill) is precisely the para 50 failure. No first-charge date is rendered in our own UI: the panel is a client component that server-renders first, so a `Date.now() + 14d` label would hydrate to a different string — Paddle's overlay shows the exact date.
- **`subscription.lastRefundAt`** is an evidence collector with **no reader**, deliberately, documented in three places so nobody removes it as dead code. It records the newest _approved_ full refund or chargeback against any subscription the guild has held, from **any** path including Paddle's own. Two invariants: it is the only column on `subscription` that is not mirrored Paddle state, so it must **survive** a re-subscribe (which works only because every Paddle-derived write is a partial `set()` over the closed `PaddleSubscriptionValues` field list — an upsert or a row spread erases it at exactly the moment it becomes interesting), and anything that ever reads it must key on **refunds from any path**, never on the `withdrawal` table. Why it has no reader, and the constraints on adding one, are in the maintainer's compliance notes (kept outside the repo).
- Crons: guild presence reconcile (`30 3 * * *` — one sweep per edition over `bot_presence` via that edition's proxy, then dangling-marker sweep + purge; also runs once at startup; manual trigger `POST /internal/reconcile/guilds`) and subscription reconcile (`0 4 * * *`; also runs once at startup after the guild reconcile so its bot-present backstop reads fresh presence; manual trigger `POST /internal/reconcile/subscriptions`); plus a withdrawal-acknowledgement retry sweep (`*/10 * * * *` — st. 6 owes the confirmation `bez odgađanja`, which the nightly sweep would not satisfy; the query is an index probe against a normally empty set).
- Presence self-heal on dashboard reads (`services/presenceHeal.ts`, wired into `GET /api/guild/:guildId`): DB says an edition absent → live `Discord.getBotMembership` check via its proxy → restore row with reconcile-sweep semantics (legacy insert + shared `services/joinRails.ts`, never a leave on a missing subscription row); 30s in-memory negative cache. Exists because re-authorizing an already-present bot fires NO gateway event. **Membership is tri-state** (`present`/`absent`/`unknown`): only a `DiscordAPIError` (a real 4xx verdict) counts as absence, while an `HTTPError` (5xx after the REST client's own 3 retries) or a network failure is `unknown` — reported up as `inconclusive`, which never writes the negative cache and makes the route throw `503 PRESENCE_UNKNOWN` instead of `409 BOT_NOT_PRESENT`. The web routes **four** failure kinds, not three (`lib/api/auth-expired.ts`): 401 → re-login; `409 BOT_NOT_PRESENT` → **stay on the page and offer the invite** (`BotAbsentCard`, wired as the boundary's `botAbsentFallback`); 403/404 → redirect to the server list; everything else incl. `503 PRESENCE_UNKNOWN` → transient, retry in place (ADR 0010) — so a Discord/proxy outage can no longer render as "the bot isn't in your server". The 409 split is the **only** place the web reads a backend error `code` rather than its status, so `BOT_NOT_PRESENT` must keep that exact string. It exists because ejecting a botless guild was actively misleading — the guild is still in the user's list and its config is still on disk — and because it is the state **every withdrawal lands in**: confirming cancels Premium immediately, the premium bot leaves, and Discord has no API for a bot to add itself, so a bounce to the server list read as "your server is gone" seconds after a refund. The card always invites the **free** bot even for an entitled guild, because the join rails make a premium bot leave again without a live entitlement, so a premium invite there can silently undo itself. It also **carries the withdrawal control** (same `shouldOfferWithdrawal` predicate, fed by the shared `useSubscriptionDetail` hook in `lib/`): the card replaces every guild tab, the subscription one included, and losing Premium is precisely what empties a guild of bots — so without it a consumer who cancelled on day 3 could not reach the control for the remaining 11 days of a window st. 2 requires throughout. That works only because the withdrawal's own two endpoints (`GET /subscription`, `POST /subscription/withdrawal`) carry **no presence check** — the 409 is thrown inside the `GET /api/guild/:guildId` handler alone, not in the shared middleware. Never move a presence check up to the router, and never re-source `WithdrawalState` from the guild-detail payload. `isBotInGuild` remains a `=== 'present'` adapter so the leave-suppression callers (`joinRails`, `registerNewGuild`, reconcile) keep their "errors mean not-present" semantics unchanged.
- Per-guild channel limit by managing edition (`Editions.resolveChannelLimit`: premium 0 = unlimited, free 3), enforced against the bot actually publishing — the free bot never serves >3 even for an entitled guild whose premium bot hasn't taken over. It returns `{ limit, reason }`; on a cap hit the `reason` (`LIMIT_FREE` / `LIMIT_PREMIUM_INVITE` / `LIMIT_PREMIUM_PENDING`) rides the 400 error `code` (via `createHttpError`/`sendErrorResponse`) so the bot (`ap/enable`) and dashboard (`ChannelLimitModal`, migrate modal) show buy-Premium vs. invite-bot vs. grant-permissions instead of one generic error. Used at both `Channels.add` and `Guilds.migrate`.
- **Registration is guarded in the services, not the routes**: `Channels.add` and `Guilds.migrate` both reject a channelId that is not an announcement channel of that guild, against `Discord.getAnnouncementChannels(edition, guildId)` — the one definition of "announcement channel of this guild", and also the dashboard's candidate list, so a channel can never be registrable but unlistable. In the services because `PUT /channel/:channelId` (the bot's `/ap enable`) is Docker-internal with **no auth** and takes `guildId` from the request body; its only type gate was `channel_types` on the slash-command option, which Discord documents as restricting the picker — not as a server-side guarantee. A forged row is **not** merely inert despite the hot path re-checking the type: it still migrates a legacy guild off auto-publish via the `migratedAt` upsert and burns a slot against the free cap, and **another guild's** announcement channel would be force-published, since `Channel.isEnabled` is keyed on channelId alone. Fails closed. Runs **before** the cap read, so ids the caller has no claim to cannot probe a guild's channel count. Rejection carries `code: NOT_ANNOUNCEMENT_CHANNEL`, which both clients must branch on **before** their channel-limit handling — otherwise a 400 with an unknown code renders as "you hit your channel limit" in the bot and opens `ChannelLimitModal` in the dashboard. The dashboard's branch is the legitimately reachable one (a channel demoted while the page was open). ⚠️ `DELETE /channel/:channelId` takes no `guildId` and so cannot make the matching ownership check; the dashboard's own delete route does check.

**Shared packages** (packages/\*):

- **@ap/database**: Drizzle ORM schema + client for PostgreSQL (Supabase). Exports `db`, `runMigrations`, and schema table references (`guild`, `botPresence`, `channel`, `subscription` — exactly four; there is **no** `paddleCustomer` table, only a `paddleCustomerId` column on `subscription`. An older schema did have one, carrying emails, and no `DROP TABLE` migration exists — but no production database has ever existed, so there is nowhere for the legacy table to survive.

### Key architectural decisions

**Single backend, per-edition bots + proxies** (ADR 0006): one edition-agnostic backend, one Postgres, one Redis; only bots and proxies are per-edition (separate tokens, gateway connections, BullMQ queues, egress IPs). Fixes the broken upgrade funnel (checkout used to route to a backend that 404'd billing), config loss on edition switches, and doubled `GET /users/@me/guilds` calls.

**Premium handover = gated atomic swap** (ADR 0006): bot permissions don't transfer between Discord apps, so when the premium bot joins a guild the free bot covers, the premium bot idles behind a `PremiumPending` Redis marker while the free bot operates unchanged. The backend evaluates the premium bot's effective permissions across registered channels (on join + permission-change pings); when all pass it deletes the marker (premium hot path latches "active" on its first absent read) and has the free bot leave — no publishing gap, worst case seconds of double coverage (loser classifies `already_done`). Edge rules: free kicked mid-pending → premium activates immediately; free re-invited while premium manages → backend makes it leave again; premium kicked mid-pending → marker cleared, free continues. Pending may last indefinitely (dashboard banner nags).

**Backend-side entitlement gate**: `registerNewGuild(guildId, 'premium', …)` checks the subscription table; not entitled → backend has the premium bot leave via the premium proxy. No bot-side subscription check. The reconcile sweeps re-run the join rails for guilds whose `guildCreate` was missed.

**Proxy service per edition**: each `apps/proxy` instance owns all Discord REST traffic for one token — the async crosspost queue and the generic `/api/*` passthrough — sharing a single `@discordjs/rest` instance. Replaces the previous `discord-proxy` (generic container) + `crosspost-worker` (custom in-memory queue) pair. Production pins each proxy's outbound source IP (`EGRESS_LOCAL_ADDRESS_*`) for Cloudflare ban isolation.

**BullMQ-backed queue**: Jobs survive proxy restarts. `jobId: ${channelId}-${messageId}` prevents duplicate enqueues. Per-outcome handling: only intentional skips (`already_done` / `blocked` / `sublimit-lock`) drop messages; transient errors become delayed retries (≤5 min cap) or BullMQ exponential backoff (10 attempts). Every job carries an explicit priority tier (see the proxy section + ADR 0012); a delayed job re-enters the _prioritized_ set at its own tier, replacing the old implicit policy where un-prioritized bounced jobs re-entered at the front of `wait` and beat fresh ones.

**Wait when Discord asks**: `Retry-After` from rate-limit responses is honoured exactly via `job.moveToDelayed`. Never drops messages on transient 429s.

**Cloudflare-ban self-shed**: Proxy tracks 401/403/(non-shared)429 responses in-memory; at 5k in 10 min (half of Discord's 10k ceiling) the gate rejects new crossposts with 503 `Retry-After: 60` so the host IP can't get banned. Counter is filtered via `RESTEvents.Response` + `X-RateLimit-Scope` (the library's `InvalidRequestWarning` is incorrect — it counts sublimit hits).

**Allowlist + migration model**: Premium-relevant channels are explicitly registered via `/ap enable` or the dashboard migrate flow. Migration state lives in `guild.migratedAt` (Postgres, `NULL` = legacy); the `MigratedGuilds` Redis cache is derived from it (rebuilt at startup) — migrated guilds enforce the allowlist; legacy guilds auto-publish all announcement channels. `Guilds.migrate` is DB-first: one transaction (channel rows + `migratedAt`), then derived cache sync with the Redis marker written last (behavioral commit point — every partial state stays fully legacy, no compensating rollbacks). Slated for removal ~6 months after v7 ships (`migratedAt` + Redis DBs 5/7 + legacy web UX dropped together). The **sunset date shown to users is `config.legacySunsetDate`** (`@ap/config`, still a placeholder) — one definition for all four surfaces (bot `/ap overview`, dashboard banner, dashboard status, marketing `/migration`), because two surfaces quoting different deadlines to the same admin is the failure that matters. `@ap/config` reads the environment at import and so is server-only: the dashboard's legacy components are all `'use client'` and receive the date through the existing `getSiteConfig()` → `SiteConfigProvider` → `useLegacySunsetLabel()` path (the same one `isPublicInstance`/`freeBotId` already ride), while the bot imports it directly and renders `<t:…:D>` so Discord localizes it per viewer instead of baking in the dashboard's en-US string. See ADR 0005.

**Bot presence + soft delete**: A `bot_presence` row (pk `(guildId, edition)`) with `leftAt IS NULL` means "this edition's bot is in the guild" (drives dashboard `freeBotPresent`/`premiumBotPresent` and the premium revocation backstop) — NOT "guild is migrated"; legacy guilds get rows too. Kick/leave soft-deletes the presence (config + cache preserved for re-invite; any pending handover marker is cleared); re-invite (`guildCreate` → `registerNewGuild`) reactivates the presence, prunes config for channels deleted while no bot was watching (live list from the GUILD_CREATE payload), and rebuilds the derived Redis state (entries first, marker last); the reconciliation cron (daily 03:30 + once at backend startup) runs one sweep per edition (insert missed guilds as legacy + presence, restore/soft-delete by diffing that bot's guild list — rails: abort on pagination error, 1h join-race guard on `joinedAt`, `max(50, 10%)` deletion cap), then — only when BOTH sweeps completed — re-runs the join rails on the reconciled rows for inserted/restored + dual-presence guilds (premium leaves only on an existing not-entitled subscription row, never on a missing one — post-DB-reset the subscription reconcile owns revocation; missing marker for dual-presence guilds is restored; free leaves only after a live premium-membership check), sweeps handover markers (clears dangling ones, re-evaluates valid ones so stalled handovers complete within a day), and hard-purges guilds whose newest `leftAt` is >30 days old with no active presence (`Guilds.purge`, cutoff-guarded so a mid-sweep re-invite wins). Dashboard reads self-heal missing presences (live membership check + restore via the shared join rails in `services/joinRails.ts`) — Discord fires no event when an already-present bot is re-authorized, so a lost row is otherwise invisible until the nightly sweep. Presence + reconciliation are permanent. See ADR 0005 + 0006.

**Redis channel cache**: Sub-ms "is channel enabled" Redis lookups on bot's hot path (no backend RTT). Startup sync reconciles cache/DB consistency.

**5s URL delay**: Discord needs time to generate link previews. Publishing before embeds load causes followers to miss rich content.

**Aggressive Discord cache minimization**: Bot only caches bot member (for permission checks). Reduces memory footprint for high-guild-count scenarios. Uses Intents: Guilds, GuildMessages, MessageContent.

**Cluster respawn backoff**: `ClusterManager` disables native auto-respawn and schedules respawn with exponential backoff (5s/30s/60s/5min/10min, reset after 10 min of stability). Prevents a death-loop from burning the invalid-request budget.

### Database schema (Drizzle ORM + PostgreSQL)

```
guild {
  guildId (text, pk — natural key; Discord snowflakes are immutable, never reused)
  migratedAt (timestamp, NULL = legacy guild; dropped at sunset)
  createdAt, updatedAt
}

bot_presence {
  guildId (text, FK → guild.guildId, cascade delete)
  edition (text, check 'free'|'premium')
  joinedAt (timestamp, not null — reconcile join-race guard keys off it)
  leftAt (timestamp, NULL = bot in guild; soft delete, guild purged 30d after newest leftAt)
  pk (guildId, edition)
}

channel {
  channelId (text, pk — natural key)
  guildId (text, FK → guilds.guildId, cascade delete)
  filters (jsonb, array of ChannelFilter)
  filterMode (text, default 'any')
  createdAt, updatedAt
}

subscription {
  id (uuid, pk — surrogate kept deliberately: two candidate keys; a guild_id PK would bake in "one subscription row per guild forever")
  guildId (text, unique — intentionally NO FK: subscription outlives the guild row)
  paddleSubscriptionId (text, unique)
  paddleCustomerId (text)
  subscriberDiscordUserId (text)
  status (text, Paddle statuses verbatim: 'active', 'trialing', 'past_due', 'paused', 'canceled')
  paddlePriceId (text)
  billingInterval (text: 'month' | 'year')
  startedAt (timestamp — Paddle started_at; contract conclusion, fixed for the subscription's life)
  withdrawalPeriodStartsAt (timestamp — anchor of the 14-day statutory window; sticky across renewals, re-stamped ONLY on a price/interval change. Never anchor on currentPeriodStartsAt)
  currentPeriodStartsAt (timestamp — advances every renewal AND on proration; for pro-rating only, never eligibility)
  currentPeriodEndsAt, scheduledChangeAction, scheduledChangeAt, canceledAt, createdAt, updatedAt
}

withdrawal {
  id (uuid, pk, defaultRandom)
  guildId (text — no FK, same reasoning as `subscription`: the čl. 64 evidence must outlive both the guild row and the subscription)
  paddleSubscriptionId (text), paddleTransactionId (text, once known)
  consumerName, contractReference (text — stored AS PRESENTED at step 1, not as references: the record must show what the consumer saw and confirmed)
  notificationAddress (text, NULLABLE — the only field the consumer supplies, and the first email address this architecture holds. NULL = retained row, address already erased at 24 months; it does NOT ride the 11-year accounting clock, because collecting it is an Art 6(1)(c) obligation DISCHARGED by sending, and ZoR čl. 8 st. 3 t. 2 keeps participant data to `ono što je nužno`. Erasure additionally requires `acknowledgedAt IS NOT NULL` — erasing an address while the st. 6 duty is still outstanding would turn a retryable failure into a permanent breach)
  submittedAt (timestamp, not null — st. 7, decides timeliness)
  confirmedAt (timestamp — NECESSARILY EQUAL to submittedAt: one screen, one button, one sending
    event. Two columns because they answer two statutory questions, never because they can differ.
    Never reintroduce a row where this is NULL — a draft state the statute does not require would
    make the retry sweep and the address-erasure predicate ambiguous)
  acknowledgedAt (timestamp — NULL after a confirm = statutory duty outstanding, owned by the retry cron)
  refundOutcome (text — Paddle adjustment status:id, or a failure reason)
  createdAt, updatedAt
  indexes: guildId, paddleSubscriptionId, UNIQUE (paddleSubscriptionId) WHERE confirmedAt IS NOT NULL
    (one contract, one withdrawal — the double-confirm guard, because the effects include a refund;
     scoped to the subscription, not the guild, so a re-subscribe gets its own window and its own row)
}
```

**Supabase setup**:

- Local dev: `supabase start` (runs PostgreSQL at `localhost:54322`, credentials `postgres/postgres`)
- Backend Docker containers connect via `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@host.docker.internal:54322/postgres`
- Production: cloud Supabase connection string in `DATABASE_URL`
- Config: `supabase/config.toml` (committed, no sensitive data)
- Migrations: `packages/database/migrations/` (committed SQL files, run via `bun run db:migrate`)
- `runMigrations()` is called automatically at backend startup

Proxies resolve their DB triple via `ProxyDatabaseIDs[edition]` in `@ap/redis`. Uses SCAN instead of KEYS (production-safe). ioredis client (BullMQ requirement), wrapped by `@ap/redis` factory `createRedisClient(databaseId)`.

### Environment variables

**One env file for the entire monorepo, web included.** `packages/config/src/env.ts` resolves the repo root by walking up from `import.meta.url` to `turbo.json`, then loads `.env.local` then `.env` (first wins; real process env from Docker `env_file` beats both). It does NOT use `dotenv/config`, whose cwd-relative resolution differs per entry point — that is precisely why the web app used to need its own file. `apps/web` has no env file; it imports `@ap/config` server-side.

`DEPLOYMENT_MODE` (`self-host` | `public`, default `self-host`) selects the topology; see ADR 0011. Deliberately not derived from `NODE_ENV` — a self-hoster must be able to run `NODE_ENV=production` without enabling billing.

`assertRequiredEnv()` is called from each long-running process (`apps/{backend,bot,proxy}/src/index.ts`), never at module import: `next build` evaluates server modules and the web image is built before any env file exists, so an import-time throw would break the build for a token the web app never reads. It checks **required vars only** — a stray variable the current mode ignores is inert, which also lets a maintainer flip `DEPLOYMENT_MODE` on an existing env file to exercise the self-host path.

**Self-host** (`.env.example`, four values, three of them from ONE Discord application):

```
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN                      the single bot's token (required)
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID / _SECRET            OAuth login AND the invited bot — same application
AUTH_SECRET                            any random string, 32+ chars (not from Discord)
WEB_APP_ORIGIN                         optional; the bot's /ap links and the dashboard's public URL
```

`.env.example` is kept deliberately bare — four keys, one comment line each, no tuning
section. Setup prose lives in `docs/self-hosting.md` (linked from the README), which assumes
Docker is a prerequisite and stays OS-agnostic. Sharding vars are absent from the self-host
surface entirely: the default of one shard covers any self-hosted scale, so naming them only
invites tuning nobody needs.

Everything else defaults. There is no `APP_EDITION`, no proxy URL, no Paddle, no SMTP, no egress, and no `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` — the dashboard image takes **no build args** because its config is server-rendered into the client tree (`getSiteConfig` → `SiteConfigProvider`), not inlined at build time.

**Public instance** (`docs/public-instance/.env.example`): adds `DEPLOYMENT_MODE=public` plus the per-edition and billing surface.

```
NODE_ENV: development|production|test
DEPLOYMENT_MODE: self-host|public (absent = self-host)
APP_EDITION: free|premium (bot + proxy only; set per compose service; PUBLIC ONLY —
  self-host pins the edition to `premium` in config.ts and never reads this)
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN_FREE / DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN_PREMIUM: per-edition bot tokens
PROXY_URL_FREE / PROXY_URL_PREMIUM: per-edition proxy base URLs (default compose service names)
EGRESS_LOCAL_ADDRESS_FREE / EGRESS_LOCAL_ADDRESS_PREMIUM: proxy outbound source IPs (prod; empty = default route)
BOT_SHARDS / BOT_SHARDS_PER_CLUSTER
BOT_SUPPORT_GUILD_ID: guild the /admin commands register to; unset = not registered
DATABASE_URL: postgresql://... (Supabase connection string)
REDIS_URI: redis://redis:6379 (optional override; defaults to shared Docker Redis)
DISCORD_ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL: Discord webhook for ops alerts (optional; alerts disabled when unset)
PADDLE_ENVIRONMENT / PADDLE_API_KEY / PADDLE_WEBHOOK_SECRET / PADDLE_PRICE_ID_MONTHLY / PADDLE_PRICE_ID_YEARLY
PADDLE_PRICE_ID_MONTHLY_TRIAL / PADDLE_PRICE_ID_YEARLY_TRIAL: the same two prices with a 14-day trial_period.
  BOTH or NEITHER — `premiumTrialEnabled` gates every trial claim in the UI on the pair, since the
  disclosure is written before an interval is chosen. Clearing either is the trial's kill switch.
SMTP_HOST / SMTP_PORT / SMTP_USER / SMTP_PASSWORD / SMTP_FROM: outbound mail (backend). The ONLY mail
  the stack sends is the statutory withdrawal acknowledgement. Unset credentials disable sending,
  which surfaces as a failed acknowledgement rather than a silent no-op. In dev the first four come
  from the dev compose overlay (Mailpit), not from an env file — `environment` beats `env_file`, so a
  dev-only SMTP host can never render into prod.
AUTH_SECRET / DISCORD_CLIENT_ID / DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET: dashboard login (web)
DISCORD_FREE_BOT_ID / DISCORD_PREMIUM_BOT_ID: the two bot applications users are invited to.
  Server-side, NOT NEXT_PUBLIC_ — self-host collapses all three ids into DISCORD_CLIENT_ID.
BACKEND_URL: single backend base URL (web, server-only)
PADDLE_CLIENT_TOKEN: client-side token for Paddle.js, which runs in the browser — but served at
  RUNTIME through getSiteConfig() → SiteConfigProvider like the bot ids, NOT inlined as a
  NEXT_PUBLIC_ build-time value. There are now NO NEXT_PUBLIC_* variables in the whole repo.
```

**Why no `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` survives, including for Paddle.js.** Next.js reads `.env*` only from its
own app directory and never walks up to the monorepo root, and `@ap/config`'s root-env load is a
server-side import — so `NEXT_PUBLIC_PADDLE_CLIENT_TOKEN` in the root env file resolved to
`undefined` in the browser. `usePaddle` then returned no instance and the checkout button was
`disabled` forever, with **no error anywhere**: the hook's guard was a bare `return`, the page's
only signal was `disabled={!paddle}`, and the backend logged a perfectly healthy `200` with a real
`transactionId`. The fix is runtime delivery, which also (a) keeps the web image build-arg-free,
and (b) let `NEXT_PUBLIC_PADDLE_ENVIRONMENT` be **deleted** rather than renamed — the browser's
Paddle environment is now derived from the same `PADDLE_ENVIRONMENT` the backend uses, so the
overlay cannot talk to sandbox while the webhooks talk to live. That failure was silent too: the
old client default was `sandbox` whenever the variable was absent. `usePaddle` now
`console.error`s on both a missing token and a rejected `initializePaddle`.

The singular `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` is read **only** in self-host mode. The old "no singular token override" invariant is therefore preserved structurally, by never reading it in public mode, rather than by a validation rule.

## Message publishing flow

1. Discord message posted in announcement channel; bot's `messageCreate` listener fires.
2. Bot synchronously gates: `isCrosspostable` bit-flags → `canCrosspostInChannel` (cache-only `permissionsFor`) → `Handover.isActive` (premium latch; Redis only while pending) → `Guild.isMigrated` Redis → `Channel.isEnabled` Redis → `Filter.evaluate` (premium-only, HTTP to backend for the rule; matching runs in-process over `extractMessageText` — content + embeds + Components V2 text).
3. 5s delay if message has URL but no embeds.
4. Bot `fetch` POSTs `{its proxy}/crosspost/:guildId/:channelId/:messageId` (fire-and-forget, 5s timeout); `guildId` comes from the `NewsChannel`, not the nullable `message.guildId`.
5. Proxy re-runs sync gate (invalid-requests → blocked → sublimit). Rejects with 503 / 204 or accepts with 202.
6. Proxy resolves the priority tier (`boostBudget.isBoosted(guildId)` → `BOOSTED` else `NORMAL`) and enqueues a BullMQ job (its edition's queue DB) keyed by `${channelId}-${messageId}`.
7. Worker (concurrency 50) re-evaluates gate, calls `rest.post(Routes.channelMessageCrosspost(...))`, classifies result via `classifier.ts`.
8. Success → increment `SublimitCounter`, then consume one onboarding-boost unit if the job's own `opts.priority` is `BOOSTED`. Errors → cache update + skip (intentional) or `moveToDelayed` (transient) or BullMQ retry (5xx).

## Docker configuration

- **Self-host: `docker-compose.yml` at the repo root** — standalone (does NOT extend the files below), services `bot` / `proxy` / `backend` / `web` / `db` / `redis`, all always-on, no profiles and no flags. Reads `.env`, which is the reason that is the self-host filename: Compose only auto-reads `.env` from the project directory. `db` is `postgres:17-alpine` and is named `db` because `packages/database/src/client.ts` already whitelists that hostname in its no-TLS regex. Nothing but `web` publishes a port.
- **`apps/web/Dockerfile`** — `output: 'standalone'` with `outputFileTracingRoot` at the monorepo root (otherwise the `@ap/*` workspace packages are not traced in). Builds with bun, runs on `node:22-alpine` because standalone emits a Node entrypoint. Takes **no build args**.
- Base config: `scripts/bot/docker-compose.base.yml`
- Dev config: `scripts/bot/dev/docker-compose.yml` (extends base)
- Prod config: `scripts/bot/prod/docker-compose.yml`
- **`env_file` is declared per overlay, never in the base.** Compose _appends_ `env_file` across `-f` layers, so a base-level entry made every prod service load the dev env file first and silently inherit anything prod did not re-declare (verified: prod rendered `SMTP_HOST: ap-mailpit` and `PADDLE_ENVIRONMENT: sandbox`). Dev uses `.env.local`, prod uses `.env`.
- Services: `proxy-free`, `proxy-premium`, `bot-free`, `bot-premium`, `backend`, `redis` (one stack; `APP_EDITION` set per service), plus `mailpit` in the dev overlay only — prod uses a real provider and self-host has no withdrawal routes, so neither has a mail path to catch. The backend `depends_on` it, which is what pulls it into the edition-scoped starts and a bare `up backend`. Both `MP_SMTP_AUTH_*` vars are load-bearing: the backend only sends when `SMTP_USER`/`SMTP_PASSWORD` are set, and nodemailer then does `AUTH LOGIN` in the clear on 1025.
- Service dependencies: bot-{edition} → proxy-{edition} + backend + redis; backend → redis; proxy-{edition} → redis
- Health checks on proxies, backend & redis
- Development: File sync with restart, exposed ports (3101:8080 backend, 8081:8080 proxy-free, 8082:8080 proxy-premium, `127.0.0.1:6379:6379` redis — loopback-bound on purpose, since a bare `6379:6379` publishes on every interface and Redis has no `requirepass`); any subset can be started (`docker compose ... up backend` alone is enough for web/checkout work; `bot-free` pulls in its proxy + backend + redis)
- Production: No port exposure, health checks enabled

## Import conventions

- Shared packages: `@ap/*` (e.g., `@ap/database`, `@ap/logger`, `@ap/utils`, `@ap/redis`, `@ap/config`)
- Import extensions required: `.js` for TS files (ES modules)
- Workspace dependencies managed by bun workspaces

## Discord.js specifics

- Version: 14.x
- Intents: Guilds, GuildMessages, MessageContent
- Partials: Channel, GuildMember
- Uses discord-hybrid-sharding for horizontal scaling
- Aggressive cache limits (only caches bot member; never `.fetch()` on hot path)
- REST API routed through this edition's proxy `/api/*` (`config.proxyUrl`); `globalRequestsPerSecond: Infinity` (proxy is the global limiter)

## Rate limits & queue management

- Discord limit: 10 crosspost/hour per channel (`SublimitCounter` Redis DB)
- Cloudflare 10k invalid-requests/10min: proxy self-sheds at 5k threshold (in-memory tracker)
- BullMQ queue: 10 attempts with exponential backoff (2s base), `Retry-After` honoured via `moveToDelayed` (≤5 min cap), high-water mark 10k waiting jobs → 503 `Retry-After: 30`
- Single `@discordjs/rest` instance; `BurstHandler` lets interaction acks bypass crosspost queueing
