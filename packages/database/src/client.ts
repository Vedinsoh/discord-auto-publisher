 * is not a postgres.js option — an unrecognised search param is forwarded to the server
 * as a connection parameter rather than enabling TLS. An unencrypted connection works
 * fine, so nothing would surface the mistake.
 *
 * `'require'` encrypts but leaves `rejectUnauthorized: false`, defeating passive
 * eavesdropping and not an active man-in-the-middle. `'verify-full'` needs Supabase's CA
 * bundled and checked against a real connection, so it is deliberately not set blind.
